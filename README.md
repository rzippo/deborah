# Deborah

This fork includes many changes to the original code base, but the features are mostly unchanged.
The build system is now CMake, and the code is compliant to the C++20 standard.

Among the additions, the program can now output the output arrival curve related to the LUDB scenario, which is useful to integrate deborah into FIFO network studies.
